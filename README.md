# Maze Solver

This was an exercise that was done in TypeScript for a Frontend Masters
class called "The Last Algorithms Course You'll need". The course is taught
by none other than ThePrimeagen! I love the course.

I decided to implement the solution to this exercise using Rust.

This isn't optimized in any way, just a fun exercise.

## Object of the Exercise

Find a path from the beginning to the end of the maze.
