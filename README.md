# Maze Solver

This exercise is to program a maze solver using recursion. When going watching
the class the solution was presented in TypeScript. I wanted to see what the
solution would be in Rust. This isn't optimized in any way, just a fun exercise.

## Object of the Exercise

Find a path from the beginning to the end of the maze.
